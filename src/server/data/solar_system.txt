The solar system is a vast and fascinating place, consisting of the sun, eight planets, and countless other celestial objects. The largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter, which is over twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter is also known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. Scientists continue to study the solar system in order to learn more about our place in the universe.
